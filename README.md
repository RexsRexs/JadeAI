Hello this is what i call project Jade.

What i hope is to get it to work on a pair of earbuds, right now im just developing the AI's identity and finding a cheap and correct model for it.
The code is very simple so this is basicly a steal. You can just copy paste whats in my "jadeai_identity.py" file and code your own ai out of it!
You will have to make a ".env" file where it will have your "OPENAI_API_KEY" 

You have full right to use this code for any purpose that is legal, 
I'll just need the credits for it! 
Ty.
